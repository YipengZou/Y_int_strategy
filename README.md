# My plan today
1. First I will clean the dataset, calculate daily return and some other useful imformation.
2. I will divide the dataset into in-sample(training) and out-sample(validation) part. Construct the model based on training set and see how well the model works on validation set.
3. I will raise a research assumption so that I can investgate in. This assumption should be supported by market common sense, financial theory and simple validation based on this dataset.
4. I will first try some simple strategy, starting from one or two factor, and do the regression / statistics calculation to find whether there is obvious pattern between these factors and future return. If so, I can stick on it and investigate further.
5. After that, I will try to construct unlinear information, to make my model contains time information. Maybe I can try time series analysis instead of simple linear regression.
6. Based on a criteria I found the best model, then I will do the prdiction and see how it works in the validation set. If it works still good, I think this is a good strategy.
